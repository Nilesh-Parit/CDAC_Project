          <p>
            <span>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Dough Preparation:</b>
                </li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine whole wheat flour and a pinch of
                salt. Gradually add water and knead the flour to make a smooth
                and soft dough. Cover the dough and let it rest for at least
                15-20 minutes.
                <li>
                  <b>Potato Filling:</b>
                </li>
                In a mixing bowl, combine mashed potatoes, chopped onion, green
                chilies, grated ginger, cumin seeds, garam masala, red chili
                powder, turmeric powder, chopped coriander leaves, and salt. Mix
                well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated.
                <li>
                  <b>Making Aloo Paratha:</b>
                </li>
                Divide the dough into equal-sized balls, slightly larger than
                golf balls. Take one dough ball, flatten it with your palms, and
                dust it with some flour. Roll the dough ball into a small
                circle, about 4 inches in diameter. Place a portion of the
                potato filling in the center of the rolled dough. Bring the
                edges of the dough together to cover the filling and seal it
                properly. Press the stuffed dough ball gently, and then dust it
                with flour again. Roll the stuffed ball into a larger circle,
                about 7-8 inches in diameter, with even thickness.
                <li>Cooking Aloo Paratha:</li>
                Heat a tawa or griddle over medium heat. Place the rolled
                paratha on the hot tawa and cook until small bubbles appear on
                the surface. Flip the paratha and apply ghee or oil on the
                cooked side. Cook the other side until golden brown spots
                appear. Repeat the process for the remaining dough balls.
                <li>
                  <b>Serving:</b>
                </li>
                Serve Aloo Paratha hot with yogurt, pickles, or any condiment of
                your choice. Optionally, you can serve it with a dollop of
                butter or ghee on top.
