                  <b>Pizza Dough:</b>
                </li>
                In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it
                sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large
                mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center
                and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough
                forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7
                minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in
                a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a
                warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.

                  <b>Pizza Assembly:</b>
                </li>
                Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C). If you have a pizza stone,
                place it in the oven to heat. Punch down the risen dough and
                roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness. If
                you have a pizza peel, transfer the rolled-out dough onto the
                peel. If not, you can use parchment paper on a baking sheet.
                Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border
                for the crust. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over
                the sauce. Distribute the cooked and crumbled sausage, sliced
                mushrooms, bell peppers, red onions, and black olives over the
                cheese. If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza
                onto the hot stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, place
                the sheet directly in the oven. Bake for about 12-15 minutes or
                until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly
                browned. Remove from the oven and let the pizza cool for a few
                minutes.
                <li>Garnishing:</li>
                Garnish with fresh basil leaves and sprinkle with grated
                Parmesan cheese.
